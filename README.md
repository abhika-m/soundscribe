# What is it
SoundScribe is a cutting-edge application that simplifies the process of recording and transcribing conversations, tailor-made for the healthcare industry. With SoundScribe, patients can effortlessly capture important dialogues with their healthcare providers. The app goes a step further by automatically transforming these conversations into structured, organized notes. Moreover, users can customize the structure of these notes to meet their specific needs. This user-friendly tool not only makes sure vital medical information is accurately preserved but also enhances patients' comprehension and retention of healthcare discussions. It also allows both doctors and patients to actively focus on the discussion at hand rather than be focused on retaining and noting every information. SoundScribe is the ideal solution for anyone looking to streamline their note-taking process and improve their healthcare experience.

# Technologies Used

We harnessed the power of React to craft our intuitive frontend web application, ensuring a seamless user experience. Leveraging Google Cloud's advanced Transcribe feature, we transformed spoken words into precise text, capturing every nuance of the conversation. Our robust backend, hosted on AWS and powered by AWS Amplify, not only secures user data but also provides lightning-fast performance. With top-notch authentication protocols in place, your information is safeguarded at every step.

Additionally, we integrated OpenAI's cutting-edge API, enhancing our application's capabilities to generate comprehensive, intelligent notes. By combining these technologies, we've created a sophisticated platform that effortlessly captures, translates, and organizes discussions, offering you unparalleled efficiency and clarity in every interaction.
